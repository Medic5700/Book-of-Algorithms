A small collection of algorithms I've come across and needed somewhere to put. Still in early stages is mainly just finding stuff to put in here than organizing everything perfectly.
Ranges from ways to implement multiplication in microcode-like environments to various sorting algorithms. Can include some visualizations to help understand it (but only command line visulizations using ANSI... YAY)
Uses Python3 for consistancy (on Ubuntu... because ANSI support on windows is sketchy), focus is on understandability instead of efficentcy or being tied to a particular architecture (results will vary).
