A small collection of algorithms I've come across and needed somewhere to put.
Ranges from ways to implement multiplication in microcode-like environments to various sorting algorithms. Can include some visualizations to help understand it (but only command line visulizations using ANSI... YAY)
Uses Python3 for consistancy (on Ubuntu... because ANSI support on windows is sketchy)
